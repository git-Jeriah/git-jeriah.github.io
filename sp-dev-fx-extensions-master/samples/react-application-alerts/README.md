## Alert list details

This extension is dependent on a explicit `Alerts` list to be located in a hub site to which current site collection is associated. If site collection is the actual hub site, alerts list has to exist in the root of that site collection.

| Display Name | Name | Type | Required | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Alert type | PnPAlertType | choice | yes | Type of Alert to display. Urgent = Red. Information = Yellow. |
| Alert message | PnPAlertMessage | string | yes | The message you want to display in the alert |
| Start date-time | PnPAlertStartDateTime | date time | yes | The Date/Time the alert should show in the header placeholder |
| End date-time | PnPAlertEndDateTime | date time | yes | The Date/Time the alert stops showing in the header placeholder |
| More information link | PnPAlertMoreInformation | URL | no | Provides a clickable link at the end of the alert message |

> Notice that in default SharePoint Starter Kit installation this list is automatically provisioned on the hub site in the case of SharePoint Online solution. As SharePoint 2019 does NOT support hub sites, alert only works with the site collection root alerts.
